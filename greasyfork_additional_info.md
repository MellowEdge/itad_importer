This userscript adds "Export to ITAD" buttons to online game vendors who do
not provide a way for sites like IsThereAnyDeal.com to query user game lists
and wishlists remotely.

It is currently in **beta** and any bugs should be reported in the
[issue tracker](https://github.com/ssokolow/itad_importer/issues).

Currently supported vendors are:

* [DotEmu](http://www.dotemu.com)
* [FireFlower Games](http://fireflowergames.com/) (wishlists only)
* [Flying Bundle](http://www.flyingbundle.com/) (direct downloads only)
* [GOG.com](http://www.gog.com) (collection only. Wishlists supported by ITAD directly.)
* [Groupees](http://groupees.com/) (direct downloads in bundles tab only)
* [Humble Store](http://www.humblebundle.com) ([Bug:](https://github.com/ssokolow/itad_importer/issues/14) Import via whole-collection view includes Steam-only purchases)
* [IndieGameStand](http://www.indiegamestand.com)
* [ShinyLoot](http://www.shinyloot.com)

Use the screenshot sheet (right-click the screen-filling view and choose "View Image" to view at full size) if you need help finding the inserted buttons.
